# Vaccinet
Future-ICT Challange 2

### Getting started:

- Log into MetaMask Ropsten Network.
- **Please load website from Webstorm or something else if possible!** Otherwise there will be problems with MetaMask and unfourtunately also with the UI as you need a localhost server (we haven't solved that problem yet).


### Usage:

#### Customer View:
- Default initialization by opening the page
- Is able to request a vaccination (requires knowledge of a hospital account address) by filling in the hospital address window and pressing the button register
- If the customer got the vaccination he can confirm it afterwards by pressing the button confirm and gets a token
- For people who want to support they can select an amount of ether they are willing to donate in -MetaMask and can then click donate

#### Hospital View:
- Can confirm that a customer got his vaccination by filling in his address and clicking confirm

In earlier versions it was also possible to trade tokens to special users in exchange for goods (Buy service button => dummy button) and for some it was possible to sell them for Ethereum which was cut out for simplicity reasons.
